        I absoultely love cars, My love for cars first began when I was about 10 years old.
        Since then I have come a long way doing things such as modifying, fixing,
        and racing cars. I am a SCCA Auto-X driver, I am very active at SCCA
        events across IL. I started buying and selling cars before I even had a license at the
        age of 15, since then have established my very own used car dealership. I enjoy everything
        about running the dealership, it is more a hobby than it is a job.
